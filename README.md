Xhamolk's Advanced Crafting Table


Store up to 4 recipes at the Crafter. 
Now you can simply supply the required ingredients to the resources inventory, and you can pull your crafted items.

The recipes are encoded into Recipe Chips at the Encoder. 

If you want to open this repo in your IDE you'll currently need to download the dependencies manually.
(Because as of now I don't now how to make gradle do that)
You'll need the dev and src of
CodeChickenLib
CodeChickenCore
NotEnoughItems
