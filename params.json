{"google":"xact mod","tagline":"Xhamolk_'s Advanced Crafting Table","body":"### Xhamolk_'s Advanced Crafting Table\r\nCreated to ease up the crafting of complex builds' materials, such as IC2 reactor components, RP2 logic gates, and much more.\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\n-coming soon-\r\n\r\n### Upcoming Features\r\n* I plan to add support for the Ore Dictionary.\r\n* Missing ingredients shall be auto-crafted, if their recipes are set up on the machine as well.\r\n* Recipe chip changes\r\n   * I want the chips to have an greater role on the mod. I will allow portable crafting through them (as simple as with the crafter machine).\r\n   * I want to remove the encoder. The idea is to move that feature to the chips themselves. \r\n      That is: blank chips are encoded by placing the ingredients on a grid (new GUI). So, the encoding happens only client-side. \r\n   * New GUI for the chips. It has the output slot to automatically consume the ingredients (like the crafter does). Also, it has a crafting grid. \r\n      * Blank chips will have the grid interactive (semi-regular).\r\n      * Encoded chips will just render the ghost items. Missing ingredients (on the player's inv) will appear red.\r\n* Portable crafting grid. Should I add this? Hmm, probably I should append a regular crafting table to the portable xact.\r\n* Portable xact (crafter) device.\r\nIt should mimic the XACT crafter machine, but is portable. Differs at: \r\n  * Power/energy requirement?\r\n  * Is portable\r\n  * Has different amount of slots (less, or more?)\r\n\r\nAlso, when shift-clicking on the XACT machine, it transfers the contents (perhaps) ?\r\n* TESR and a model.\r\n  * Still don't know how I'm gonna mode that.\r\n* Automation modules.\r\n   * I plan to support ISpecialInventory (for BC-related stuff).\r\n   * Some sort of ISidedInventory implementation for all other mods.\r\n* IC2: UU-matter recipes (make a machine named XACT Matter Transformer).\r\n   It might have all the recipes already stored. Or use a new item for transforming UU-matter into stuff.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was created, and is currently maintained, by [Xhamolk_](https://github.com/Xhamolk/).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFollow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_Xhamolk). \r\nFile bug reports at my [issue tracker](https://github.com/Xhamolk/XACT/issues).","note":"Don't delete this file!
