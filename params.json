It aims to ease the constructor of complex builds by simplifying the tedious and repetitive task of crafting the building components. No longer will you have to manually place the recipe's ingredients on their respective slots on the crafting grid, because XACT will do it for you. Neither will you need to remember the recipes, because XACT can encode any recipe into a Recipe Chip, which is portable. \r\n\r\nWith XACT, you no longer have the need to spend hours on your crafting room, since your recipes will already be stored on your XACT Crafter Machines. Once you have set up your XACT Crafter(s), it's now a matter of simply passing by, pick up your items as if they where on a chest already, and moving on to your building ground.\r\n\r\nThe best of XACT surely is it's portability. The XACT Craft Pad is your best bet for when you are not at home, because it can work as a regular workbench, but it's portable! Also, it can read the recipes from the Recipe Chips, and keeps stored the last recipe you used; but also has a button clear the crafting grid, because we all know that's annoying. \r\n\r\n> \"So, recipes encoded into chips, you say? Won't that take a lot of room on your inventory?\"\r\n\r\nAbsolutely not! That's why the Chip Case is also provided by XACT. It can store up to 30 Recipe Chips in it's internal storage. You can even create a bunch and name them to have your recipes from different mods separated.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n-coming soon-\r\n\r\n## Usages\r\n* RP2 logic gates\r\n* IC2 Nuclear Reactor components\r\n* GraviSuit components.\r\n* So much else... \r\n\r\n## Author\r\nThis project was created, and is currently maintained, by [Xhamolk_](https://github.com/Xhamolk/).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFollow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_Xhamolk). \r\nFile bug reports at my [issue tracker](https://github.com/Xhamolk/XACT/issues).","tagline":"Xhamolk_'s Advanced Crafting Table","name":"X.A.C.T.","google":"xact mod"}
